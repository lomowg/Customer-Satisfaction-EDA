# Customer Satisfaction
In this project, I conducted EDA (exploratory data analysis) of a dataset with various information about ratings from customer surveys of cafes and restaurants. The dataset is taken from the Kaggle: [Customer satisfaction 10K+ records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedaliraja/customer-satisfaction-10k/data)

The following aspects were investigated as part of the analysis:
* Visualising the distribution of scores for different criteria (delivery, food, time, order correctness).
* Building a boxplot to analyse the total amount of evaluations depending on the correctness of the order.
* Maximum score analysis to identify the impact of different aspects on overall satisfaction. 
* Correlation analysis to identify the relationships between different scores.

Overall, the project allowed us to understand which aspects of service have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction and identify potential areas for improvement.
# Tools
For the analysis I used the Python language and the corresponding libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
